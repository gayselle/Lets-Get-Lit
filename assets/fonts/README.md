# fonts/

Place web fonts or self-hosted font files here (WOFF, WOFF2, TTF). If you add licensed fonts, ensure you have the right to include them in the repository.

Example usage in CSS:

@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyFont';
  src: url('../assets/fonts/MyFont.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}
