# Starter HTML Workspace

This is a minimal scaffold for static HTML/CSS projects.

Quick start (macOS / zsh):

```bash
cd /Users/gaysellebcorsame/Documents/LGL
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` script runs `lite-server` and serves `index.html` at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Files of interest:
- `index.html` — starter page
- `css/styles.css` — basic styles
- `assets/` — put images and other static assets here

Replace the author field in `package.json` and update this README as needed.
